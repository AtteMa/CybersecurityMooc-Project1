# Cyber Security Base course project 1

This is the course project 1 containing a csrf flaw and four flaws from the [OWASP top ten 2021](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

Link to the repository: https://github.com/AtteMa/CybersecurityMooc-Project1

You can test the demo project by downloading and extracting the files and running the following commands:

```
pyhton manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

After successfully launched, you can find the demo project at [](http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/)

Cross-Site Request Forgery is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a malicious website tricks a user's web browser into performing actions on a different website without their knowledge or consent. CSRF attacks exploit the trust that websites have in a user's browser. When a user is logged into any website, their browser stores authentication cookies that are automatically sent with future requests to that site. For example, an attacker can create a website containing malicious POST requests to the target website, using the legitimate users stored cookies to make it appear as if the user sent the request. To prevent CSRF attacks, websites use CSRF tokens. These tokens are unique for each user session and must be included with any request that changes data on the site. The server verifies the tokens authenticity, ensuring the request is legitimate and not generated by a malicious website.

Django has a built-in CSRF token functionality. To fix this issue, we need to remove the comments from {% csrf_token %} line in every form in our application and django will handle the rest.
